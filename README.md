# flexIC

**flexIC** is a high-precision Imanâ€“Conover engine for generating continuous variables that preserve **rank correlation** with **marginal fidelity**. It offers **tunable convergence control**, allowing you to aggressively reduce rank-correlation distortionâ€”at the cost of a few extra milliseconds.

Use it to:
- Simulate data with a target Spearman or Kendall structure
- Preserve original variable distributions via back-ranking
- Validate or stress-test statistical methods under structured dependence

## ðŸš€ Why use `flexIC`?

Most Imanâ€“Conover implementations:
- Run once with no convergence check
- Do not guarantee low error
- Break marginal shapes in edge cases

**flexIC**:
- Iterates until **max abs rank-correlation error â‰¤ Îµ**
- Keeps original marginal shapes intact
- Returns detailed error diagnostics
- Finishes in milliseconds on typical datasets
